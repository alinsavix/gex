As part of a larger Gauntlet (II) reverse engineering project, I've often
wanted a decent tile/stamp extractor, but such a thing does not (AFAIK!)
actually exist publicly. I wanted one, so I made one.

Okay, that's not completely true. I'm *making* one. At the moment, it's
very very lame. Like, not-useful-yet lame. But I'm working on it.

This is also my first golang program (seemed like a good excuse to learn),
so it's probably double champion edition gold platnum++ lame. Totally
open to suggestions on improvements, though. Especially once the code is
more than an empty husk of its future self.
